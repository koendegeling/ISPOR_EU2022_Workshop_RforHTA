# Accelerating Adoption and Standardization of R in Health Technology Assessment: the Case of Discrete Event Simulation 

This script details several discrete event simulation (DES) implementations in R as presented at during the workshop "Accelerating Adoption and Standardization of R in Health Technology Assessment: the Case of Discrete Event Simulation", which was presented at the 2022 European meeting of the Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) in Vienna, Austria.

This workshop was presented as a combined effort by a group of export who are jointly working on a book chapter on implementing DES in R for Health Technology Assessment:

* Mark Clements, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden
* Mohsen Sadatsafavi, University of British Colombia, Canada
* James O'Mahony, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland
* Hendrik Koffijbeg, University of Twente, Netherlands
* Petros Pechlivanoglou, University of Toronto, Canada
* David Rios, Ontario Health, Canada
* Koen Degeling, Lumen Value & Access, United States/Netherlands
